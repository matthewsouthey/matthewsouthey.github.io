This is a list of books related to Buddhism that I made for a friend. Most of these books have a high signal/noise ratio, although some of them are quite academic.

**Resources for New Meditators**

There is a massive amount of material on meditation – choosing where to start can feel like drinking from a firehose. Here are some recommendations.

_The Mind Illuminated_ by John Yates  
One-stop-shop for all your meditative needs. Covers every step of the path from absolute beginner to stream-entrant.

_Mindfulness in Plain English_ by Henepola Gunaratana  
The classic no-nonsense introduction to meditation, with many solutions to common problems.

_Waking Up_ by Sam Harris  
A good introduction to Buddhism for atheists and skeptics. Surprisingly even-handed and non-judgmental.

**Overviews of Buddhism**

_Introduction to Buddhism_ by Peter Harvey  
A very good overview of Buddhism. Scholarly and reliable introduction that is fairly comprehensive. I first read this book in college for a “Buddhism 101” class. I’ve re-read it multiple times since.

_Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations_ by Paul Williams  
A good resource, but a little textbookey (it's a textbook).

**Tibetan Buddhism and Tantra**

_Introducing Tibetan Buddhism_ by Geoffrey Samuels  
A good ethnographic introduction to Tibetan Buddhism.

_Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism_ by John Powers  
Another very good, and perhaps more well-rounded, intro that goes in-depth on key aspects of Tibetan Buddhism.

_The Alchemical Body_ by David Gordon White  
An amazing introduction to tantric ideas of the body. 

_Tantra in Practice_ by David Gordon White  
A great collection of essays concerning Tantra in different contexts.

For canonical texts of Tibetan Buddhism, I really like the series put out by _Library of Tibetan Classics_ particularly their editions on Mind Training and Mahamudra.

_Tantric Treasures_ by Roger Jackson  
Incredible poetry from old-school Tantric masters Saraha, Tilopa, and Kanha. I recommend digging into Saraha's poetry, a real goldmine of fascinating tantric ideas.

**Philosophy**

Two of the best books on Buddhist philosophy are _Indian Buddhist Philosophy_ by Amber Carpenter and _Buddhism as Philosophy_ by Mark Siderits. Carpenter is a little bit more accessible in my opinion.

**Buddhism and Cognitive Science**

If you’re interested in the field, you should read the holy grail of Buddhism and cognitive science: _The Embodied Mind_ by Varela, Thompson, and Roche. From there you can dig deep into Varela (I recommend _Ethical Know-How_) or Thompson (_Mind in Life_ is his scientific magnum opus and _Waking, Dreaming, Being_ is a popular introduction to a variety of problems at the intersection of Buddhism and cognitive science).
