**I.**

The classic example of a [perverse incentive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perverse_incentive) is during the British Raj in India when cities were overrun by cobras. The colonial government instituted a system where civilians could bring in cobra heads for a cash reward. Initially this lead to the diminishment of the cobra population since cobras were a ubiquitous pest. However, as the cobra population dwindled, Indians began breeding and farming cobras and brining in their heads. When the British caught wind of this, they stopped offering the cash reward, which made all the farmed cobras worthless. The cobra farmers released the cobras into the city, thereby raising the cobra population above the initial level. This is a case of value optimization having a paradoxical effect - the situation ends up worse rather than better. In any system, stated values may fail to be optimized and other values prioritized in their stead.

What causes this malignant shift to other values, is the nature of metrics. For a given goal, there are quantifiable metrics that allow progress to be tracked. The stated value of reducing cobras was measured by cobra heads brought to the authorities. What the British didn’t realize, was that the metric isn’t ONLY correlated with wild cobras that are caught and killed. In fact, it is more efficiently correlated with increasing cobra populations rather than with decreasing cobra populations.

**II.**

Every morning I teach English online to Chinese students. The kids are great, the pay is alright, and besides the early hors (5-9am) there isn’t much to complain about.

The tutoring company, has recently taken China by storm and has a massive client base of Children all over China ranging from 2 – 14 years old. Parents sign up in the hope that their kids can learn English from a native speaker more effectively than from a Chinese English teacher.

The company's stated purpose is to educate children, to maximize child learning. However, it does not play out this way: the value that is being optimized is customer satisfaction. And the customer is not the child, it’s the parent.

After teaching a class, there is a box where the teacher leaves feedback for the parent. Parents rate the teacher using a 5-apple scale and these ratings are used by the company to determine contract renewal, raises, etc.

he first week of teaching, I would fill the feedback box with positive constructive feedback for the student. And in the first week I received a slew of poor ratings, with the parent’s comments saying (in English translation) “teacher is rude, teacher is inexperienced, etc.”. I contested these low ratings with the company, but they always sided with the parent. I’ve found out from talking with others that the company sides with the parent most of the time – they have no reason not to, they’re the paying customers. After my first week, I began giving students glowing feedback with only a few words reminding the student to “continue to read”. I now have a perfect formulaic response where I change a few words, and copy-paste it into the review box. And all of as sudden, my ratings shot up. 

Students aren’t totally voiceless, some of them will tell the parents how the class went, or even rate the teacher themselves. If the children don’t enjoy the class, then they will tell their parents that they were bored, that the teacher was bad, and that they didn’t learn anything. To avoid this problem, a teacher’s goals must shift from maximizing education, to maximizing amusement. You become a clown, who happens to speak a different language.  In class the other day, I was teaching a beginner who would hit the “Teacher Behavior Issue” button when he didn’t know the answer to a question – I was incentivized to not correct the student and promote mindless verbal repetition. 

I’ve seen many children way above their appropriate level since no teacher wants to “hold a child back”. The child is stuck with an incomprehensible lesson while the teacher is trying to entertain away the fact that very little education is happening.

To move to a higher-level, the student must be tested on their knowledge and the teacher must fill out a form that gives a student a grade out of 40. For every question the students gets wrong, the teacher’s score is more likely to suffer. 

Any attempt to correct the student is seen as an insult to the child, any failure of the student is seen as the teacher’s failure to teach. The teacher is only good when he allows “the natural brilliance of the student to shine” – anything else is a negative reflection of the teacher.

Happy parents or happy students does not necessarily equal educated students. Obviously, students will learn better if they do not hate attending class, but education necessarily involves challenge. Blockbuster movies prioritize entertainment, education does not; education involves some amount of fun but not the worship of it – education _should be_ the ultimate goal.

**III.**

The values that are being optimized are out-of-wack from the company’s stated goals.

- Instead of maximizing constructive feedback, laudatory applause is maximized

- Instead of maximizing the teacher-student learning dynamic, being a clown is maximized

Parent satisfaction is the metric that is measured and business decisions are based off of it. Customer satisfaction is the most important thing to the company – and the customer isn’t the child, it’s the parent. Unfortunately there are many ways this metric can be achieved that doesn’t involve the child effectively learning English.

I’m not incentivized (beyond my moral commitment) to fight for this issue – in fact, reporting this problem might simply be seen as an admission of personal failure. The fact that the company is private, only exacerbates the focus on maximizing consumer (parent) satisfaction. I highly doubt this will change because education metrics are difficult measure, and because fundamentally, the company has no incentive to change! It is more profitable to offer low quality educationtainment to the masses, than specialize in high-quality education for a few. After all, every parent wants to feel that their child is intelligent, and every child wants to be entertained. It might be that entertainment and the _idea_ of education is simply a better profit formula than _actual_ education.

Every single unit of energy given towards increasing student-education (beyond that which is necessary to convince the parent that “education is taking place”) is not only unnecessary, but possibly detrimental. In fact, due to [the principle of least effort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_effort) and since incentives are prioritizing the parent’s perception, any student-education above the bare minimum required is unlikely.

Parents must be very self-aware to prioritize their child’s education and not just the image of their child’s education. Some parents might realize that the praise is over-done and the actual education is minimal.  I have regular students who I can give more critical response too – but if I fail to recognize this preference, then I might get a bad rating.  The majority of parents prefer the facsimile to the truth; most of the time, it is safer to be too overly praiseworthy than to give accurate assessments.

The problem of perverse incentives, ideas over fact (false value optimization), and the drift of complex social systems are found within most human endeavors. It is a global issue, but China is dealing with extremely acute forms of these problems. Corruption, plagiarism, and disregard for truth and accuracy are pernicious elements even within fields that are meant to emphasize these attributes. While striving for scholastic excellence, the wrong values are being maximized due to measuring the wrong metrics.

 In science journals, the metric of “papers published” is leading to plagiarism rather than original research. [This study](https://www.nature.com/articles/467153d), found that 31% of submissions to a science journal were plagiarized. In China, academic fraud is pernicious due to a few [causal factors](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2010/09/the-dire-state-of-chinese-science/344138/) despite increased [government investment](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/345/6200/1006.full) in R&D.

In my experience, Chinese ESL teaching is prioritizing surface-level metrics over more rigorous metrics, perhaps for the sake of ease and profit. Since these incentives might be beneficial to the company it might not truly be a perverse incentive (regardless if the incentives were purposefully applied). The solution to this problem is not entirely clear; creating systems that achieve their stated goals is notoriously difficult. Without a solution, some of the world’s most important institutions will continue to fruitlessly spin their wheels in the pursuit of their stated values.
